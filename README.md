Jarvis Predictive Personal Assistant
=========

### 3rd Place at Greylock Hackfest.

Jarvis is a Messenger chatbot that pulls in information from various API's (The New York Times, Yelp, Lyft, Swarm, Google Calendar, Maps) in order to make predictive decisions to empower your routines. He surfaces the information you want, when you want it. By bridging data from different sources, Jarvis can eliminate all friction in juggling these apps throughout your daily routine.

## Pitch
As companies like Lyft, Fitbit, Foursquare, Google etc. are becoming increasingly popular, the amount of information about us that is stored online has grown rapidly. Between all these companies it's possible to get an extremely detailed view of someone's life. 

When do they go to work? Where do they live? How often do they exercise? What do they like to eat?

Unfortunately, this information is divided among all these apps, when in reality we have routines and habits that would benefit greatly from uniting this data. We’re all accustomed to rapidly switching between different contexts for a given goal. Even organizing a simple dinner could involve checking Yelp, Google Calendar, and Google Maps - doesn’t this mental overhead sound unnecessary?

Jarvis takes this burden off of your shoulders. He pulls in information from over 7 different companies  and makes predictive decisions to help you throughout the day. With Jarvis, organizing a dinner can be done in a single Messenger conversation - he will check Yelp, Google Calendar, and even transit times for you! Do you often need to go to a certain address (work) around 9AM and another (home) at 5PM? Jarvis can detect this and order a Lyft for you at that time. He’ll even go beyond that and provide a daily digest (with New York Times articles and a To-Do list) for your ride!

Jarvis surfaces the information you want, when you want it. By bridging data from different sources, Jarvis can eliminate all friction in juggling these apps throughout your daily routine.
